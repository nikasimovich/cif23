# Core 1: Interaction – Syllabus
<br/>
<p>
  Core 1: Interaction is designed to introduce students to programming as a creative medium—as a way of making and exploring. The coursework focuses on developing a vocabulary of interaction design principles which can then be applied across a range of platforms. Students are encouraged to experiment with various media, tools, and techniques, ultimately producing a portfolio of interactive and visual projects designed for the screen. An emphasis is placed on typography as it applies to a screen context, research-based problem solving and a learning-through-making approach to technical skill building. Historical and current interaction design precedents will be discussed.</p>
<p>
  You can think of this class as a hands-on workshop where our browser is a canvas. We’ll experiment with code, develop formal design principles, and think about how our work fits into the broader context of the internet at large.
