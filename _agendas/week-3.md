### Homework
1. Using HTML and CSS, create the next harmonic collection entry. In this entry, explore typographic hierarchy. We haven&rsquo;t gone over using custom typefaces yet, so for now, use [HTML safe fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.php) and design details like color, alignment, scale, spacing to communicate hierarchy. Do not use custom typefaces yet.
- Submit a zip file of the index.html and the CSS file on Canvas.
