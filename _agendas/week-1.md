### Homework
1. Come to class with three ideas for your Harmonic Collection’s theme. This can be created in a google slide or a PDF and should be ready to be shared at the start of class. Your presentation should include (for each idea) – 1 slide that explains the idea generally and visually; 1 slide that explains why you&rsquo;re interested in the idea; and then 2 or 3 additional slides that highlight some visual examples of sketches, inspiration, ideas, or other websites you like
2. Look out for an invitation for Figma from me
