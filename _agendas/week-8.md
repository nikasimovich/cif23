### Homework
1. Edit and refine your midterm entries so that they tell a complete story and also include a navigation structure on the interior pages. In addition to being on time and refining your collection,  you will also prepare a short written doc (one paragraph) that explains your collectionâ€™s theme so far and explains three other avenues you can explore the theme for the remaining weeks of the semester. Please turn this in on Canvas at 9am next week, and we will discuss it at our meeting.
